🏅 Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners
This project explores over a century of Nobel Prize history through interactive visualizations. By analyzing recipient data across categories, countries, and gender, we uncover key patterns and trends in the evolution of the world’s most prestigious awards.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains detailed information about Nobel Prize laureates, including:

Name – Winner's full name

Category – Prize category (e.g., Peace, Literature, Chemistry)

Country – Country of birth or affiliation at the time of award

Gender – Gender of the recipient

Year – Year the prize was awarded

Motivation – Short summary of the reason for the award

🎯 Project Objectives
📈 Visualize trends in Nobel Prize awards over time

🌍 Analyze country-level contributions to Nobel achievements

👤 Examine gender disparities in prize distributions

🧪 Compare categories based on frequency and diversity

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

pandas – for data wrangling

matplotlib & seaborn – for static visualizations

plotly – for interactive charts

DataCamp DataLab – interactive notebook environment

📊 Key Insights
The number of Nobel Prizes awarded has grown significantly since the early 1900s.

The United States has emerged as a dominant contributor in recent decades.

Women remain underrepresented, especially in scientific fields.

Peace and Literature prizes often show more geographical diversity than science prizes.

🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook directly in DataCamp DataLab, then run the cells sequentially:

Load and preview the Nobel dataset

Clean and transform the data as needed

Create visualizations to answer key questions

Explore trends by category, gender, and geography

📌 Future Improvements
Integrate interactive map visualizations (e.g., choropleths)

Add decade-based analysis and timeline animations

Analyze average age or field-switching patterns of winners
